        "- https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html\n",

        "#### 3) Consider accessibility as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "For qualitative plotting Seaborn's 'colorblind' palette is recommended. For maps with sequential or diverging it is recommended to use one of the Color Brewer schemes which can be previewed at https://colorbrewer2.org/.\n",
