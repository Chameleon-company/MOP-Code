    "In the bustling city of Melbourne, efficient waste management is crucial for maintaining cleanliness, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring public health. With the advent of smart bin technology, which can monitor fill levels in real-time, there's an opportunity to revolutionize waste collection processes. This project aims to optimize waste collection routes for smart bins in Melbourne, leveraging real-time data integration, route optimization algorithms, and environmental considerations. Key datasets required include smart bin locations, fill level data, traffic patterns, road network information, and regulatory guidelines. While some data may be sourced from the client's open data portal, additional datasets like real-time traffic data may require collaboration with local authorities or third-party providers. By optimizing collection routes, we aim to minimize fuel consumption, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance overall efficiency in waste management operations throughout Melbourne.\n"

    "To ensure our dataset is primed for analysis, we undertake a comprehensive data type optimization process. This involves adjusting the data types of various columns to more accurately reflect their content and optimize memory usage. Here's an overview of the steps taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Timestamp Conversion**: Convert the `time` and `last_update` columns to `datetime` objects to facilitate time series analysis.\n",
    "2. **String Specification**: Change `serial`, `sensor_name`, `description`, and `address` columns to the `string` data type for consistency in text data handling.\n",
    "3. **Category Optimization**: For columns like `bin_status` and `product_type`, we use the `category` data type when we have a limited set of possible values, enhancing memory efficiency and performance during grouping operations.\n",
    "4. **Numerical Adjustments**: Ensure numerical data, such as `wastebasket_size`, is correctly typed (`float`) for accurate mathematical computations.\n",
    "5. **Geolocation Handling**: Split the `latlong` column into separate `latitude` and `longitude` columns and convert them to `float` data types, dropping the original `latlong` column to simplify geographical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These adjustments are crucial for the following reasons:\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Optimizing data types can significantly reduce memory usage, making data manipulation more efficient.\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Ensuring data types match the nature of the data prevents errors during analysis.\n",
    "- **Convenience**: Having the right data type (e.g., datetime) simplifies operations like date range filtering or time-based aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By refining our dataset's structure through these changes, we lay a solid foundation for robust and error-free data analysis.\n"

    "### 2.3 Improving the Detail of Time-Related Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This segment focuses on refining our dataset's temporal data by splitting the 'time' column into distinct 'date' and 'time_only' columns. This transformation aids in detailed time-based analysis and enables more flexible data manipulation. Here are the key steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Datetime Parsing**: Initially, we ensure the 'time' column is correctly parsed into datetime format with `pd.to_datetime(data['time'], errors='coerce')`. The `errors='coerce'` parameter converts any parsing errors into NaT (Not a Time), preventing data corruption.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - The `date` column is created to store only the date component of each entry.\n",
    "   - The `time_only` column is created to store only the time component.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: In cases where datetime parsing results in all null values (indicating parsing issues), both `date` and `time_only` columns are set to `None`. This precaution ensures the dataset's integrity remains uncompromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Previewing Changes**: Finally, we display the first few rows of the newly created `date` and `time_only` columns to verify the split was successful and to provide a glimpse into the data structure post-transformation.\n",

    "\n",
    "A crucial step in data preprocessing involves identifying and quantifying missing values within our dataset. This process enables us to understand the extent of missing data and strategize on how to handle it. We approach this in two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Missing Values**: We utilize `data.isnull().sum()` to calculate the total number of missing values in each column of our dataset. This method checks each cell for null values, providing a column-wise sum. The output is printed under \"Current Missing Values,\" offering immediate visibility into which columns contain missing data and to what extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculating Missing Data Proportion**: To grasp the significance of the missing values, we calculate their proportion relative to the total dataset size. This is achieved by dividing the number of missing values in each column by the total number of rows in the dataset, then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. The results are printed under \"Current Missing Values Proportion,\" giving us a clear picture of how much data is missing across each column.\n",

    "A vital part of preparing our dataset for analysis involves ensuring that it does not contain significant gaps that could distort our findings. To this end, we take two decisive actions to handle missing data effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dropping Rows with Missing `latlong` Data**: Recognizing the critical nature of geographical data for our analysis, we remove any rows where the `latlong` information is missing. This is achieved with `data.dropna(subset=['latlong'])`, ensuring that our dataset only includes entries with valid geolocation data. This step is crucial for analyses that depend on spatial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**: Further refining our dataset, we decide to eliminate columns that are not essential to our specific analytical goals. In this case, `last_update` and `wastebasket_size` columns are removed using `data.drop(columns=['last_update', 'wastebasket_size'])`. This decision might be driven by factors such as the columns' relevance to the research question, a high proportion of missing values, or the desire to streamline the dataset for efficiency.\n",

    "### Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "For styling within your markdown cells, there are two choices you can use for headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can use HTML classes specific to the use case styling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-header\">This is a subsection header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;\">This is a subsection header.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-blurb\">This is a blurb header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em; font-style:italic;\">This is a blurb header.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Or if you like you can use the markdown header styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```# for h1```\n",
    "\n",
    "```## for h2```\n",
    "\n",
    "```### for h3```\n",

    "## Plot colour schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "General advice:\n",
    "1. Use the same colour or colour palette throughout your notebook, unless variety is necessary\n",
    "2. Select a palette based on the type of data being represented\n",
    "3. Consider accessibility (colourblindness, low vision)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) If all of your plots only use 1-2 colors use one of the company style colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Light theme | Dark Theme |\n",
    "|-----|-----|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#2af598;\">#2af598</p>|<p style=\"color:#08af64;\">#08af64</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#22e4ac;\">#22e4ac</p>|<p style=\"color:#14a38e;\">#14a38e</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#1bd7bb;\">#1bd7bb</p>|<p style=\"color:#0f9295;\">#0f9295</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#14c9cb;\">#14c9cb</p>|<p style=\"color:#056b8a;\">#056b8a</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#0fbed8;\">#0fbed8</p>|<p style=\"color:#121212;\">#121212</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#08b3e5;\">#08b3e5</p>||\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) If your plot needs multiple colors, choose an appropriate palette using either of the following tutorials:\n",
    "- https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html\n",
    "- https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Consider accessibility as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For qualitative plotting Seaborn's 'colorblind' palette is recommended. For maps with sequential or diverging it is recommended to use one of the Color Brewer schemes which can be previewed at https://colorbrewer2.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to design your own colour scheme, it should use the same principles as Cynthia Brewer's research (with variation not only in hue but also, saturation or luminance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to acknowledge your sources and any attributions using links or a reference list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have quite a few references, you might wish to have a dedicated section for references at the end of your document, linked using footnote style numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can connect your in-text reference by adding the number with a HTML link: ```<a href=\"#fn-1\">[1]</a>```\n",
    "\n",
    "and add a matching ID in the reference list using the ```<fn>``` tag: ```<fn id=\"fn-1\">[1] Author (Year) _Title_, Publisher, Publication location.</fn>```"
