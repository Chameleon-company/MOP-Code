    "\n",
    "Acceptance Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficient Route Planning: The solution should provide optimized routes for waste collection vehicles to pick up waste from smart bins across different areas of Melbourne.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Real-time Data Integration: The system should integrate real-time data from smart bins to dynamically adjust collection routes based on current fill levels and demand patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Minimize Environmental Impact: The optimized routes should aim to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by minimizing travel distance and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Traffic Congestion Reduction: The solution should consider traffic patterns and congestion hotspots to avoid delays and optimize route efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cost-effectiveness: The optimized routes should minimize operational costs associated with waste collection, including labor, fuel, and vehicle maintenance. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Scalability: The solution should be scalable to accommodate the growing number of smart bins and evolving waste collection needs in Melbourne.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. User-Friendly Interface: The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing waste management authorities to easily visualize and manage waste collection routes."

    "\n",
    "This segment focuses on refining our dataset's temporal data by splitting the 'time' column into distinct 'date' and 'time_only' columns. This transformation aids in detailed time-based analysis and enables more flexible data manipulation. Here are the key steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Datetime Parsing**: Initially, we ensure the 'time' column is correctly parsed into datetime format with `pd.to_datetime(data['time'], errors='coerce')`. The `errors='coerce'` parameter converts any parsing errors into NaT (Not a Time), preventing data corruption.\n",

    "   - The `date` column is created to store only the date component of each entry.\n",
    "   - The `time_only` column is created to store only the time component.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: In cases where datetime parsing results in all null values (indicating parsing issues), both `date` and `time_only` columns are set to `None`. This precaution ensures the dataset's integrity remains uncompromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Previewing Changes**: Finally, we display the first few rows of the newly created `date` and `time_only` columns to verify the split was successful and to provide a glimpse into the data structure post-transformation.\n",

    "To enhance clarity and facilitate easier identification of sensors in our dataset, we adopt a naming convention that incorporates the last two digits of each sensor's serial number. This step not only simplifies the analysis but also adds a layer of readability when dealing with multiple sensors. Here's how we accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update Sensor Names**: We prefix every sensor name with \"Sensor-\" and append the last two digits of its serial number using `data['serial'].str[-2:]`. This approach ensures each sensor has a unique and identifiable name based on its serial number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reflecting Changes**: After updating the 'sensor_name' column, we create a placeholder DataFrame to preview the changes. This DataFrame includes both 'serial' and 'sensor_name' columns, displaying how the sensor names have been updated based on the serial numbers.\n",

The output is printed under \"Current Missing Values,\" offering immediate visibility into which columns contain missing data and to what extent.\n",

    "A vital part of preparing our dataset for analysis involves ensuring that it does not contain significant gaps that could distort our findings. To this end, we take two decisive actions to handle missing data effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dropping Rows with Missing `latlong` Data**: Recognizing the critical nature of geographical data for our analysis, we remove any rows where the `latlong` information is missing. This is achieved with `data.dropna(subset=['latlong'])`, ensuring that our dataset only includes entries with valid geolocation data. This step is crucial for analyses that depend on spatial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**: Further refining our dataset, we decide to eliminate columns that are not essential to our specific analytical goals. In this case, `last_update` and `wastebasket_size` columns are removed using `data.drop(columns=['last_update', 'wastebasket_size'])`. This decision might be driven by factors such as the columns' relevance to the research question, a high proportion of missing values, or the desire to streamline the dataset for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "For styling within your markdown cells, there are two choices you can use for headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can use HTML classes specific to the use case styling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-header\">This is a subsection header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;\">This is a subsection header.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-blurb\">This is a blurb header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em; font-style:italic;\">This is a blurb header.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Or if you like you can use the markdown header styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```# for h1```\n",
    "\n",
    "```## for h2```\n",
    "\n",
    "```### for h3```\n",

    "## Plot colour schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "General advice:\n",
    "1. Use the same colour or colour palette throughout your notebook, unless variety is necessary\n",
    "2. Select a palette based on the type of data being represented\n",
    "3. Consider accessibility (colourblindness, low vision)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) If all of your plots only use 1-2 colors use one of the company style colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Light theme | Dark Theme |\n",
    "|-----|-----|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#2af598;\">#2af598</p>|<p style=\"color:#08af64;\">#08af64</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#22e4ac;\">#22e4ac</p>|<p style=\"color:#14a38e;\">#14a38e</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#1bd7bb;\">#1bd7bb</p>|<p style=\"color:#0f9295;\">#0f9295</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#14c9cb;\">#14c9cb</p>|<p style=\"color:#056b8a;\">#056b8a</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#0fbed8;\">#0fbed8</p>|<p style=\"color:#121212;\">#121212</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#08b3e5;\">#08b3e5</p>||\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) If your plot needs multiple colors, choose an appropriate palette using either of the following tutorials:\n",
    "- https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html\n",
    "- https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Consider accessibility as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For qualitative plotting Seaborn's 'colorblind' palette is recommended. For maps with sequential or diverging it is recommended to use one of the Color Brewer schemes which can be previewed at https://colorbrewer2.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to design your own colour scheme, it should use the same principles as Cynthia Brewer's research (with variation not only in hue but also, saturation or luminance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to acknowledge your sources and any attributions using links or a reference list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have quite a few references, you might wish to have a dedicated section for references at the end of your document, linked using footnote style numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can connect your in-text reference by adding the number with a HTML link: ```<a href=\"#fn-1\">[1]</a>```\n",
    "\n",
    "and add a matching ID in the reference list using the ```<fn>``` tag: ```<fn id=\"fn-1\">[1] Author (Year) _Title_, Publisher, Publication location.</fn>```"
