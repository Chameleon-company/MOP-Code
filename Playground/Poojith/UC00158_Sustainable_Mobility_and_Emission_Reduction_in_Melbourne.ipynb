        "# Sustainable Mobility and Emission Reduction in Melbourne\n",
        "\n",
        "**Duration:** 90 minutes  \n",
        "**Level:** Intermediate  \n",
        "**Pre-requisite Skills:** Python, APIs, Pandas, Data Visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scenario\n",
        "\n",
        "Melbourne is known for its liveability and progressive sustainability efforts, but like many growing cities, it's facing the pressures of increased traffic and rising carbon emissions. To reduce its environmental footprint and improve urban mobility, the city has been actively promoting walking and cycling as alternatives to car use.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project explores how active transport—specifically walking and biking—can play a major role in reducing emissions across Melbourne. By analyzing real-time sensor data provided by the City of Melbourne, we aim to understand when and where people are choosing sustainable transport options, and how much CO₂ is potentially being avoided as a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this analysis, we hope to provide clear, actionable insights that support Melbourne’s sustainability goals, while also highlighting opportunities for infrastructure improvements that encourage more people to choose walking and cycling over driving.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Description\n",
        "\n",
        "While Melbourne has seen great efforts to promote walking and cycling, most transportation reports still focus on emissions produced rather than emissions prevented. But every time someone walks or cycles instead of taking a car, that's an avoided car trip—and avoided emissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project flips the typical emissions analysis by focusing on **emissions avoided** through active transport. Using live data on pedestrian and cyclist activity, we aim to estimate how many short trips might have otherwise been taken by car, and how much CO₂ was saved in the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll also explore patterns in this sustainable behavior: what time of day people choose to walk or bike, which locations have the most activity, and how different zones in the city compare. These insights can help guide policy, public investment, and future infrastructure upgrades.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenge\n",
        "\n",
        "> How can we use real-world data to measure and support Melbourne’s shift toward greener transportation?\n",
        "\n",
        "To answer this, we:\n",
        "- Use live APIs to collect pedestrian and bicycle sensor data from across the city\n",
        "- Clean and merge the datasets based on time and location\n",
        "- Estimate how much CO₂ would have been produced if these trips were done by car\n",
        "- Calculate the environmental savings from walking and biking\n",
        "- Identify the most sustainable hours of the day (“green hours”)\n",
        "- Highlight key hotspots and zones for infrastructure investment\n",
        "\n",
        "By tackling this challenge, we not only explore the impact of active transport, but also create tools to help Melbourne build a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable transport network.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Sustainability Impact\n",
        "\n",
        "This project directly supports Melbourne’s commitment to sustainability and climate action, aligning with two key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**  \n",
        "  By encouraging safe, accessible, and low-emission transport options like walking and cycling.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **SDG 13: Climate Action**  \n",
        "  By estimating emissions avoided through active transport and helping the city track progress toward its net-zero goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The City of Melbourne has committed to becoming a net-zero emissions city by 2040. Projects like this help make that possible by quantifying the impact of behavior change and providing data to guide better transport and planning decisions.\n"

        "Once the pedestrian dataset is loaded, we perform a series of preprocessing steps to prepare it for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Datetime Conversion:**  \n",
        "   The `sensing_date` column is converted into a standard datetime format to allow easier time-based analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Column Renaming:**  \n",
        "   The `hourday` column, which indicates the hour of the day, is renamed to `hour` for clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Trip Volume Calculation:**  \n",
        "   The total number of pedestrians detected at each sensor is calculated by summing the counts from both directions (`direction_1` and `direction_2`), and stored in a new column named `count`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Time Features Extraction:**  \n",
        "   We extract additional useful time features such as the weekday (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) and month name from the `sensing_date` column.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Geolocation Parsing:**  \n",
        "   Each sensor’s geographic coordinates are extracted from the `location` dictionary and split into two new columns: `latitude` and `longitude`.\n",
        "\n",
        "These preprocessing steps ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for merging with other transport datasets or for use in time-based and spatial analyses.\n"

        "As part of the ongoing project titled **“Sustainable Mobility and Emission Reduction in Melbourne,”** we have successfully completed the initial phases, which include integrating live datasets from the City of Melbourne Open Data API, preprocessing both pedestrian and bicycle data, and visualizing pedestrian trends through hourly, weekday-based, and map-based analyses. These foundational steps help highlight active mobility patterns across the city and lay the groundwork for deeper sustainability insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the upcoming weeks, the project will continue with the integration of bicycle activity data, merging datasets based on time and spatial proximity, and estimating carbon emissions avoided due to active transport modes. Further analysis will include identifying walk- and bike-dominant zones, calculating peak “green hours” for sustainable transport, and mapping out CO₂ savings across key locations. The final deliverables will include advanced visualizations, emissions analysis, and policy-aligned recommendations supporting Melbourne’s climate and mobility goals under SDG 11 and SDG 13.\n"
