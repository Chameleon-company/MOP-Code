    "I am planning to open a new cafe in Melbourne. To ensure that my business is well-prepared to meet customer demands, I use data analysis and predictive analytics to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distribution Analysis:  \n",
    "     - I start by visualizing the concentration of cafes and restaurants in various areas of Melbourne.\n",
    "     - I learn that certain areas, like the Melbourne CBD, have a high density of cafes and restaurants, which might indicate a competitive environment but   also a high customer base.\n",
    "2. Seating Capacity Analysis:  \n",
    "     - I analyze the average seating capacity for indoor and outdoor seating in different areas.\n",
    "     - This helps me decide whether to focus more on indoor or outdoor seating based on popular trends in my chosen location.\n",
    "3. Industry Analysis:\n",
    "     - I explore the prevalent types of businesses (e.g., pubs, takeaway food services) in my desired area.\n",
    "     - I discover that there is a higher concentration of takeaway food services, prompting me to consider whether I should incorporate a similar model or differentiate my cafe with unique offerings.      \n",
    "4. Geospatial Analysis:\n",
    "     - I use a map to highlight the geographic distribution of existing cafes and restaurants.\n",
    "     - I identify potential hotspots for my cafe where there is a demand for more dining options.\n",
    "5. Trend Analysis:\n",
    "     - I look at trends in business activity over recent years, highlighting growth areas and emerging neighborhoods.\n",
    "     - I notice an upward trend in new cafes opening in the suburbs, indicating a potential opportunity for less competition and growing customer interest.\n",
    "6. Prediction Task:\n",
    "     - using a predictive model, I receive an estimated optimal number of seats for my cafe based on my chosen location, industry type, and other relevant factors.\n",
    "     - The model predicts that my cafe should ideally have around 50 indoor seats and 20 outdoor seats to maximize customer satisfaction and business efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario demonstrates how data analysis and predictive modeling can provide practical support for launching a successful cafe in Melbourne, helping me meet customer demands and optimize business performance.\n"

    "\n",
    "For styling within your markdown cells, there are two choices you can use for headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can use HTML classes specific to the use case styling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-header\">This is a subsection header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;\">This is a subsection header.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em; font-style:italic;\">This is a blurb header.</p>\n",
    "\n",

    "## Plot colour schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "General advice:\n",
    "1. Use the same colour or colour palette throughout your notebook, unless variety is necessary\n",
    "2. Select a palette based on the type of data being represented\n",
    "3. Consider accessibility (colourblindness, low vision)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) If all of your plots only use 1-2 colors use one of the company style colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Light theme | Dark Theme |\n",
    "|-----|-----|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#2af598;\">#2af598</p>|<p style=\"color:#08af64;\">#08af64</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#22e4ac;\">#22e4ac</p>|<p style=\"color:#14a38e;\">#14a38e</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#1bd7bb;\">#1bd7bb</p>|<p style=\"color:#0f9295;\">#0f9295</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#14c9cb;\">#14c9cb</p>|<p style=\"color:#056b8a;\">#056b8a</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#0fbed8;\">#0fbed8</p>|<p style=\"color:#121212;\">#121212</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#08b3e5;\">#08b3e5</p>||\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) If your plot needs multiple colors, choose an appropriate palette using either of the following tutorials:\n",
    "- https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html\n",
    "- https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Consider accessibility as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For qualitative plotting Seaborn's 'colorblind' palette is recommended. For maps with sequential or diverging it is recommended to use one of the Color Brewer schemes which can be previewed at https://colorbrewer2.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to design your own colour scheme, it should use the same principles as Cynthia Brewer's research (with variation not only in hue but also, saturation or luminance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to acknowledge your sources and any attributions using links or a reference list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have quite a few references, you might wish to have a dedicated section for references at the end of your document, linked using footnote style numbers.\n",
    "\n",
