The use case aims to compare the performance of Melbourne's municipalities with other fast-growing Australian cities in terms of environmental sustainability and wellbeing. This information will help city officials and policymakers make informed decisions about how to improve the quality of life for residents and ensure a sustainable future. 
The primary stake holders involved in this use case are the city officials and policymakers who will use the data to make decisions, as well as researchers and analysts who will collect and analyse the data. The use case will cover various aspects of environmental sustainability and wellbeing, including but not limited to air quality, water quality, waste management, access to green spaces, and health outcomes.
The steps involved in this use case proposal are as follows:
a. Collect and compile data: we will gather data from City of Melbourne Database and compile it in our GitHub. 
b. Analyse the data: The data will be analysed to identify trends and patterns, as well as to compare the performance of Melbourne's municipalities with other fast-growing Australian cities.
c. Develop a report: A report will be created to summarize the findings of the analysis. The report will include trends observed and recommendations for how to improve environmental sustainability and wellbeing in Melbourne's municipalities. The report can also include additional information, such as case studies of successful initiatives in other cities, to help inform decision-making.
The use case proposal will provide valuable information to city officials and policymakers in Melbourne, as well as other fast-growing Australian cities, about how to improve environmental sustainability and wellbeing. By identifying areas of strength and weakness, the data will help guide the development of policies and programs that support a more liveable and sustainable future.
