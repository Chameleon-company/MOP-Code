    "Optimization of the Outdoor or Open-Space Fitness Activities In Melbourne\n",
    "Authored by: Ananya Krishnan\n",
    "Duration: 90 mins\n",
    "Level: Intermediate\n",
    "Pre-requisite Skills: Python, , Geospatial Analysis, Clustering, Predictive Modelling, Machine Learning\n",

    "Scenario\n",
    "In the city of Melbourne, population of people who prefer outdoor fitness is around 10.3 million. Thus, the problem identified in such activities are as follows-\n",
    "1. Ideal spots to execute their workouts.\n",
    "2. Viable enhancements of such outdoor facilities that are useful to everyone in general are predicted.\n",
    "3. Recommendations report generated for the same.\n",
    "The final objective is to solve such problems, to do so a solution is created such that all issues are tackled. The places for fitness training are showcased on the map of melbourne city.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this use case will teach you\n",
    "At the end of this use case you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "How to install packages and import data. \n",
    "Load the data using APIs.\n",
    "Cleaning, manipulating, and pre-processing the data according to the requirements.\n",
    "Geospatial analysis performed, followed by k-means clustering to retrieve the exact locations where open-space exercises can be done.\n",
    "Visualising and mapping the entire information.\n",
    "Predictive modeling utilized for enhancement predictions of the open spaces.\n",
    "Provide data-driven recommendations for optimal placing of aminities and shaded areas.ß\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply performing daily routine exercises anywhere is not just hazardous to one's safety but also brings in lots of other troubles to folks around. Thus, some specific spaces exist for this purpose. Where it is, what enhancements are possible based on needs of an avid exerciser, and what recommendations can be provided in any report in this regard; become major concerns. The root roadblocks that these identified problems can bring in are accidents on roads/hindrance to others in various forms, if basic aminities like (drinking fountains, washrooms or seats) are not there then it can be reported to government, and to do so a suggetstion report has to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with all this mess a solution is developed using the stack of technology mentioned above where step-by-step everything is sorted."
