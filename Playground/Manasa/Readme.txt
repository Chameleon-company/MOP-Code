Description or Aim of the use case:

The aim of this use case is to analyze the dataset "Jobs per ANZSIC for blocks" collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE) and correlate it with house prices by small area. Investigate the relationship between employment trends in different ANZSIC industries and house prices in small areas within the City of Melbourne. Determine if there is a correlation between changes in ANZSIC employment levels and fluctuations in house price. Identify which ANZSIC industries, if any, have the most significant impact on house prices. I am aiming to gain more understanding of the dynamics between employment patterns and housing markets in Melbourne, ultimately contributing to more informed urban planning and economic development strategies.
