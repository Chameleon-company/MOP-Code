{"At the end of this use case you will:\n\n-   I will learn how to merge and clean datasets from different sources,\n    ensuring data consistency for analysis.\n-   Performing Exploratory Data Analysis I will learn to understand the\n    structure of the data, identify patterns, and uncover relationships\n    between variables.\n-   I will gain experience in assessing the correlation between\n    employment trends across various industries and house prices in\n    different areas, using statistical techniques.\n-   This use case will provide an opportunity to apply statistical\n    methods to analyze the data, such as hypothesis testing and\n    regression analysis, to draw meaningful conclusions.\n-   I am Planning to upskill with machine learning to explore machine\n    learning algorithms to predict house prices based on employment data\n    and other factors, enhancing your understanding of predictive\n    modeling techniques.\n-   By analysing the impact of employment on housing prices, I will gain\n    insights into urban planning considerations and the economic\n    dynamics of melbourne areas.\n\nIn this project, I will be analyzing the relationship between employment\ntrends and housing prices within the City of Melbourne. By searching\ninto datasets provided by the City of Melbourne, I aim to understand how\nfluctuations in employment across different industries impact the\nhousing market. This analysis holds significant implications for urban\nplanning, economic development, within Melbourne. The datasets include\ninformation on employment levels categorized by industry (ANZSIC codes)\nand housing prices by small area. Employment patterns have a great\ninfluence on housing demand and property prices. Changes in employment\nlevels within specific industries can lead to shifts in population\ndemographics, housing preferences, and overall market dynamics.\nUnderstanding these correlations is essential for urban planners, and\nstakeholders to make informed decisions regarding housing affordability,\nworkforce development, and infrastructure planning.\n\nThrough this project, I would like to understand the insights of the\nrelation between employment and housing markets. By leveraging data\nscience techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning\nalgorithms, I aim to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that\ncan inform strategic decision-making processes. Ultimately, my goal is\nto contribute to the creation of smarter, gain deeper insights into the\ndynamics of cities, and identify the areas for improvement, and develop\ninnovative solutions to advance inclusive and strong communities.\n\n-   Jobs per ANZSIC for blocks\n-   House Prices by Small Area - Sale Year\n\n-   Import important Libraries\n-   Connect, Test and Analysis of Datasets\n\n    # Standard\n    import os\n    import json\n    import io\n    # Data import\n    import requests\n\n    # Data manipulation\n    import pandas as pd\n    import seaborn as sns\n    from scipy import stats\n    import seaborn as sns\n    import numpy as np\n    import matplotlib as mpl\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    from scipy import stats\n    from sklearn.svm import SVR\n    from scipy.stats import norm, skew\n    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix\n    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso\n    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, RandomizedSearchCV\n\n    def download_and_load_csv(url):\n        response ": null}
