    "The city of Melbourne is ever changing, it has a need to adapt to its ever growing population. As a part of that change the city of Melbourne should look at how that change has occurred. What needs have to be met, what changes have we made before that had positive impacts and how does changing one aspect of the city's infrastructure affect others? In that same vein, we now better understand the positive impacts of green spaces within our lived environment. As a part of that the cities we live in need to accommodate trees for cooling, clean air and have positive impacts on our mental health. The Urban Forest project was created as a way to look at current tree locations and over the years has collected data on how the green life in Melbourne has changed. In this project we will investigate how the green spaces in Melbourne have evolved."

This dataset is made up of different years dating back to 2008. From that initial dataset we are going to walk through the steps of loading in each year and comparing them to one another to create a better picture of how the Melbourne green areas have changed if at all. We will look at if there are increases or decreases in trees and investigate how long some have been there. From that information we can evaluate if more efforts are needed to improve Melbourne's green spaces or how to protect the ones that are there."

    "From this we have confirmed a few important things that will affect how we go forward when working with this data. First, we have a few datasets and each seems to be different from one another. First, some of the datasets are much larger than others for example the 2019 dataset has roughly 114,000 entries. Whereas the initial 2008 dataset has only 58,000 entries. So we will need to figure out what they cover and to what extent all of the different datasets are compatible with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing is that some of the earlier dataset have more information than the later ones. Since we are comparing all datasets and their progression we will need to make the data more compatible. So we will only look at a few columns. We will keep the `geo_point_2d`, `geo_shape` and the `id`. Keeping in mind that the 2021 has no `id` so we will see if it can be backfilled based on the `geo_point_2d` data we have. We will also use the 2011 `yearplant` data for some trees with an ID. That way we can see how old some of the trees are and if they are still around in later datasets. This will require a few assumptions about the data. First the `id` is consistent through the whole dataset and doesn't change each year or over the years. For measuring consistency and how long a tree has been in a location we will need to rely on the `geo_point_2d`s to be the same and if not very consistent with one another.\n",
