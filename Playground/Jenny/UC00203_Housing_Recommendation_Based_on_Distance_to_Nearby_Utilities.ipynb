For policymakers and urban planners, understanding how well rental properties are served by these facilities is crucial for identifying underserved areas, prioritizing infrastructure investments, and ensuring equitable access across the community.\n",

    "This below code snippet reorganises the merged GTFS table so it’s indexed by (\"stop_name\", \"trip_id\"), which makes looking up all rows for a given station fast. The check_direct_route function then pulls all stop-time rows between two stations, merges them on find trips that include both stations, and filters to keep only those where A’s stop_sequence comes before B’s so that we could find a direct train that reaches B after A on the same trip. It returns a boolean indicating whether such trips exist plus the matching trip_ids. Finally, that function is applied row-by-row to the speadsheet, comparing each listing’s nearest station to work place nearest station, producing two new columns: has_direct_route (True/False) and direct_trip_ids (the list of matching trips)."

By using this tool, tenants can input their workplace address or any other place in interest (like shopping malls, a friend's house or doctor's adress), and have a holistic view of how each rental listing can meet their needs and choose the most suitable one."
