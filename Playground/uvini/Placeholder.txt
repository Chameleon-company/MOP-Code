Focus Area: Environment & Wellbeing 
 

Description: Analyse areas with higher tree density, diversity, or specific types of trees correspond to higher bird species richness or abundance. diverse tree populations might support more diverse bird species, indicating a healthier urban environment.

Objective 

To analyze the relationship between tree density, diversity, and specific types of trees with bird species richness and abundance in the City of Melbourne. This study aims to determine whether diverse tree populations support more diverse bird species, thereby indicating a healthier urban environment. 

Key Activities 

• Data Collection and Preparation: 
- Download and clean the bird survey results dataset and the urban forest dataset. 
- Merge datasets based on common geographical locations. 

• Data Analysis: 
- Calculate tree density and diversity metrics for different areas within Melbourne. 
- Assess bird species richness and abundance in the same areas. 
- Use statistical methods to identify correlations between tree characteristics and bird diversity/abundance. 

• Visualization: 
- Create maps and charts to visualize the distribution of tree species and bird populations. 
- Develop visual representations of the correlation between tree diversity and bird species richness. 

• Reporting: 
- Summarize findings in a comprehensive report. 
- Highlight areas with high biodiversity and propose recommendations for urban planning and environmental conservation. 

Expected Outcome 

• Insight into Urban Biodiversity: A clear understanding of how tree diversity and density affect bird species richness and abundance in Melbourne. 
• Healthy Environment Indicators: Identification of specific tree types and densities that support a more diverse and abundant bird population, serving as indicators of a healthier urban environment. 
• Guidance for Urban Planning: Data-driven recommendations for urban forestry practices to enhance biodiversity and wellbeing in urban areas.
