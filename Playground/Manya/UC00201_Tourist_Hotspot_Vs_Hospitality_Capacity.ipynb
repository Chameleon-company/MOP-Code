    "## Tourist Hotspots vs Hospitality Capacity: Are There Enough Seats?\n",
    "\n",
    "Millions of tourists visit Melbourne every year, drawn by its famous alleyways, cultural landmarks, exciting events, and entertainment districts, making it one of Australia's most energetic travel destinations. However, as thousands swarm the Arts Precinct, Federation Square, or the Yarra, a crucial question arises.:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Can the city’s hospitality infrastructure keep pace with the sheer volume of foot traffic?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The difficult balance between pedestrian density and the accessibility of surrounding café and restaurant seating at Melbourne's busiest tourist destinations is analyzed in this use case. I will be  identifying areas where demand may be exceeding supply by combining comprehensive information on hospitality venues with real-time foot traffic data from Melbourne's pedestrian counting sensors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The information gathered tells a story about the visitor experience and goes beyond simple statistics.  There is a chance if the data shows that visitors are in bustling areas but have nowhere to sit and take in Melbourne's culinary culture.  By making sure that Melbourne's exceptional attractions are complemented by dining options, urban planners, business owners, and tourism authorities may take calculated steps to increase the city's allure.\n",
    " \n",
    "The ultimate goal of this analysis is to enhance Melbourne's standing as a city that not only astonishes with views and experiences but also extends a warm welcome to all guests.  \n"

    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Problem Matters  \n",
    "Melbourne is thriving as a top travel destination. The city draws millions of tourists eager to experience its culture, sports, cuisine, and entertainment, from the bustling vibrancy of Federation Square to the serene charm of its alleyways. However, underlying this lively influx of people comes a straightforward but significant problem:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Do our most popular tourist hotspots have enough nearby dining seats to match the demand?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The visitor experience is negatively impacted when families find it difficult to get a table at busy periods or when travelers are unable to find a café chair after hours of wandering. Additionally, Melbourne's reputation as a friendly, livable, food-loving city diminishes as experience declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Story  \n",
    ">**As a** Melbourne tourism planner and hospitality industry analyst,  \n",
    ">**I want** to know if well-known tourist spots have enough dining options close by so that  \n",
    ">**I** can identify areas where guests might have trouble finding a seat and suggest prime locations for new hospitality venues or capacity expansion.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Framing the Challenge  \n",
    "This issue is about **shaping experiences**, not just about seats and numbers. We may find hidden mismatches, such as streets full of people but lacking tables, or places with unrealized potential for hospitality expansion, by combining real-time pedestrian flow data with comprehensive information about hospitality venues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution will help:  \n",
    "- **Planners** ensure infrastructure matches demand  \n",
    "- **Hospitality businesses** capture opportunities in high-traffic zones  \n",
    "- **Tourism authorities** strengthen Melbourne’s reputation as a city that delights visitors at every step (and every bite).  \n",

    "## Section 4: Hospitality Capacity Analyzis\n",
    "I applied the geographic reasoning required to evaluate the hospitality capacity close to popular tourist destinations in this stage. I started by creating a `calculate_distance` function that calculates the distance (in meters) between two latitude/longitude locations using the **Haversine formula**. The `find_nearby_venues` function, which I then developed, looks through all hospitality venues and chooses those that are **200-meter walking radius** from a hotspot. It keeps track of information about each neighboring location, including the industry sector, number of seats, seating kind, and trading name. The analysis concentrates on the **immediate dining options** that are practically accessible to tourists at each hotspot by using this 200m criterion, which is around a two to three minute walk.  \n",

    "I examined the **hospitality capacity within 200 meters** of each of the 25 tourist destinations that were identified in this step. The code computed seating metrics and looked for venues in the vicinity of each hotspot. Included in this were the overall number of locations, the number of seats available, the proportion of indoor versus outdoor seating, and the number of cafés, restaurants, pubs, and bars. Also, a critical performance indicator was added: **seats per 1,000 daily visitors**, which gauges how effectively the dining capacity of each hotspot satisfies the demand from pedestrians. A new DataFrame (`capacity_df`) summarizing the availability of hospitality surrounding all 25 hotspots was created using the data. This lays the groundwork for determining potential areas where demand may exceed supply. "

    "Our research showed glaring disparities in the way Melbourne's tourism infrastructure meets visitor needs. With an average of over 1,100 adjacent venues and close to 70,000 seats each hotspot, Melbourne's central business district boasts an outstanding dining density. But the distribution of capacity is not uniform.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are thousands of seats for every 1,000 patrons at several venues, such as **Russell Street, Chinatown, and Bourke Street Mall**. However, there are significant gaps between the number of visitors and the amount of food alternatives at important locations including the **Melbourne Convention Centre, Southern Cross Station, and Spencer Street/Collins**. This reveals a discrepancy between Melbourne's dining infrastructure and its busiest event/transport hubs.  \n"
