c: I was working on two projects - Kloeckner Metals (USA) and Avis Budget Group (Europe) during my time as a techno functional consultant for Cash App, I was the sole liason between the company and the client. Hence, it was my responsibility to build connections and relationships with not only the clients but also the top hierarchy in the Company. 
A: The first thing I did was to arrange interactive sessions with the clients to understand how they think, what they require and how they react to situations. I made efforts to listen actively and understand the pain points of the clients. Once I understood the pain points and requirements, I could tailor the solutions for them. I had to adapt my communication to a different way for both clients as they had different backgrounds and responsibilities. There were a lot of delays in between, but my best policy is to always stay honest with the client, not trying to keep them in the dark about any issues, delays or additional costs to company.
R: This was greatly appreciated by them, and very soon, they wanted only me as a consultant who they would speak to about their problems. This made way for a better dynamic between myself and the clients. They were so happy with the services and consultation that they decided to buy more features in the Cash Application, generating more revenue for the company.
E: This experience taught me that everyone has a different temperament, and require a different approach for them to feel comfortable working with you. It needs efforts, time and patience. I've incorporated this in my University as well where I lead the Company Project as a senior leader.

C: In my time with IBM, my first project was with Citibank where I mostly worked on FDIC and CCAR reports and dealt with technologies like Hadoop, UNIX, Hive, Sqoop, etc. When this project ended and I was selected to be onboarded as a Application Developer for a new project - Energy Australia, the onboarding requirement was to be well versed in ODI, EDQ, CI/CD Pipelines.
A: Recognizing the gap, I immediately took the initiative to upskill myself. I broke down the requirements and created a focused learning plan. I used a combination of IBM’s internal learning resources, Oracle documentation, and hands-on tutorials to get up to speed. I dedicated extra hours outside of work to practice ODI mappings, understand data profiling with EDQ, and explore tools like Jenkins and Git for CI/CD. I also reached out to peers and mentors who had experience in these tools for guidance and best practices.
R: Within three weeks, I was confident enough to demonstrate my knowledge to the project team. I successfully cleared the onboarding technical assessments and joined the Energy Australia project on time. Eventually, I was trusted with core development tasks and even contributed to automating parts of the data pipeline, improving efficiency.
E: This experience taught me the value of adaptability and proactive learning. By taking ownership of my development, I was not only able to meet the technical requirements but also gained confidence to handle future transitions into unfamiliar technologies. It's something I now see as a strength—I thrive when there's something new to learn.

Context:
I was responsible for tailoring and modifying a product called Cash Application for a client. My tasks included enabling specific functionalities, activating necessary dashboards for reporting, and setting up data transformation rules based on their business logic. However, during development, the client’s business requirements and logic kept changing frequently, which caused significant delays and rework.
Action:
To manage this, I introduced a more agile approach. I proposed having bi-weekly sync-ups with both business stakeholders and the technical team to review any changes in real time. I also maintained a detailed change log and implemented modular design principles so that each transformation rule or feature could be updated independently without affecting the rest of the system.
Result:
By improving communication and restructuring how changes were handled, we were able to reduce turnaround time for updates by almost 40%. This not only got the project back on track but also built stronger trust with the client.
Evaluation:
This experience taught me that adapting isn’t just about reacting to change—it’s about anticipating it and building flexibility into your process. Since then, I always factor in change management strategies when planning projects, which helps me stay focused even in fast-evolving environments.

-------------------------------------

Context:
Because of the work I delivered on my previous project, I was assigned to a high-stakes project with Avis Budget Group, which was at serious churn risk. The client had been promised an 80% automation hit rate, but the actual performance was only 15%. The project was on the verge of being discontinued, and the pressure to deliver was extremely high.

Action:
I began by conducting a thorough root cause analysis of why the automation wasn’t meeting expectations. I collaborated with business analysts and technical leads to redefine the automation rules, identify exceptions, and redesign key components of the workflow. I also re-trained the data pipeline to handle more diverse scenarios and incorporated robust exception handling. To meet the deadline, I planned daily progress checkpoints and worked extended hours to test and validate updates iteratively.

Result:
Within a few weeks, we improved the automation hit rate to over 70%, which completely shifted the client’s perception. The project was retained, and our team was recognized internally for turning around what was seen as a failing engagement.

Evaluation:
This challenge taught me how to stay calm under pressure, focus on high-impact areas, and lead with a problem-solving mindset. It also reinforced how important it is to manage expectations transparently while staying solution-oriented in tight timelines.
