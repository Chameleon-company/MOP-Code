They are positioned high on tram poles to give aerial performances with each gust of wind. The vanes have been conceived to represent specific aspects of Melbourne: the bird symbolises the city's parks and gardens; the horse symbolises its culture and sport; the fish refers to its waterways; and the pig represents the city's hope and future ' the latter a tongue-in-cheek reference to `pigs can fly'. Jenkins said of the sculpture, `I wanted each of these weathervanes to be cartoon-like and even frivolous. We take our cities for granted and with the daily pedestrian bustle it is always business as usual. It takes something very unusual to attract someone's eye. I want people to look up and smile!'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The City of Melbourne commissioned Jenkins to make this work, which took him four months to complete.

Weaver figures these three Melbourne pioneers as `pedestrians of vast time' who have returned to the city streets and says her interpretation of them is driven by humour rather than by iconoclasm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three Businessmen Who Brought Their Own Lunch was commissioned in 1993 as part of the Swanston Street Art Works Program, and was a gift to the City of Melbourne from the Republic of Nauru to celebrate the city's 150th anniversary.</td>\n",

The program, adopted in 1992, allocates one percent of the City of Melbourne''''''''s capital works budget to funding public art. Its goal was to enable \"public art to be successfully integrated into the fabric of design and development in the city.\"<br><br><br><br>   \n",

       "21   Four weathervanes, in the shapes of a horse, pig, fish and bird, positioned above tram poles which rotate with the wind. Hand beaten copper with gold leaf detail.<br><br>Each of the four weathervanes takes the shape of an animal: a horse, pig, fish and bird. They are positioned high on tram poles to give aerial performances with each gust of wind. The vanes have been conceived to represent specific aspects of Melbourne: the bird symbolises the city's parks and gardens; the horse symbolises its culture and sport; the fish refers to its waterways; and the pig represents the city's hope and future ' the latter a tongue-in-cheek reference to `pigs can fly'. Jenkins said of the sculpture, `I wanted each of these weathervanes to be cartoon-like and even frivolous. We take our cities for granted and with the daily pedestrian bustle it is always business as usual. It takes something very unusual to attract someone's eye. I want people to look up and smile!'<br><br>The City of Melbourne commissioned Jenkins to make this work, which took him four months to complete. Lord Mayor Councillor Des Clark unveiled Weathervanes at 11am on Friday 19 March 1993.   \n",

Artist Alison Weaver claims that while the men are named and motionless, they are also intended to be anonymous and to represent being `trapped in the perpetual motion of consumerism'. Weaver figures these three Melbourne pioneers as `pedestrians of vast time' who have returned to the city streets and says her interpretation of them is driven by humour rather than by iconoclasm.<br><br>Three Businessmen Who Brought Their Own Lunch was commissioned in 1993 as part of the Swanston Street Art Works Program, and was a gift to the City of Melbourne from the Republic of Nauru to celebrate the city's 150th anniversary.   \n",

Hand beaten copper with gold leaf detail.<br><br>Each of the four weathervanes takes the shape of an animal: a horse, pig, fish and bird. They are positioned high on tram poles to give aerial performances with each gust of wind. The vanes have been conceived to represent specific aspects of Melbourne: the bird symbolises the city's parks and gardens; the horse symbolises its culture and sport; the fish refers to its waterways; and the pig represents the city's hope and future ' the latter a tongue-in-cheek reference to `pigs can fly'. Jenkins said of the sculpture, `I wanted each of these weathervanes to be cartoon-like and even frivolous. We take our cities for granted and with the daily pedestrian bustle it is always business as usual. It takes something very unusual to attract someone's eye. I want people to look up and smile!'<br><br>The City of Melbourne commissioned Jenkins to make this work, which took him four months to complete.
