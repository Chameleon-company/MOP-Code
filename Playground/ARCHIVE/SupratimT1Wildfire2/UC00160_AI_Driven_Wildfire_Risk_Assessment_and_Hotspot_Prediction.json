  "name": "AI Driven Wildfire Risk Assessment and Hotspot Prediction",
  "description": "There is a need to leverage the technological advancements in Data Science , Analytics and Artifical Intelligence, to build a data driven solution that can assess the wildfire risk in real time. Incorporating techniques such as temporal and geospatial analysis, predictive modelling and machine learning can open new avenues for us to achieve this objective, giving us valuable insights to shift to a more Proactive approach rather than a reactive approach. This project aims to deliver on such a solution, to dynamically assess environmental factors to calculate the risk associated with that particular area, enabling informed decision making for public authorities, sending timely alerts, enforcing safety measures and optimize the resource allocation.",
