    "<b>Throough this project we can see the overall distribution of the Jobs and Population from the Forecast data provided by SGS from 2020 to 2041. This findings in this project will be beneficial to the stakeholders which may include city planners, policy makers and entrepreneurs and many other entities. This project can help them understand how mange the resources within a particular area that we saw in this project. This project shows the change in population in different areas and the popular jobs in those area. This project also shows, the changes that will take place in furture in terms of population growth and job growth. The jobs are seperated by industries which would help the stakeholders organize resources to industries that will see a major growth in future and also the necessary infrastructure in those areas to support the population growth as a consequence. This project also utilizes the power of Machine Learning where the model predicts the growth that will take place in the population based on the city and year that are inputted to the model. The model uses present data to train an algorithm that can then effectively find the values for future data.</b>"
