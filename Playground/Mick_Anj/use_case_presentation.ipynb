    "### Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "For styling within your markdown cells, there are two choices you can use for headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can use HTML classes specific to the use case styling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-header\">This is a subsection header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;\">This is a subsection header.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-blurb\">This is a blurb header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em; font-style:italic;\">This is a blurb header.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Or if you like you can use the markdown header styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```# for h1```\n",
    "\n",
    "```## for h2```\n",
    "\n",
    "```### for h3```\n",
    "\n",
    "```#### for h4```\n",
    "\n",
    "```##### for h5```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plot colour schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "General advice:\n",
    "1. Use the same colour or colour palette throughout your notebook, unless variety is necessary\n",
    "2. Select a palette based on the type of data being represented\n",
    "3. Consider accessibility (colourblindness, low vision)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) If all of your plots only use 1-2 colors use one of the company style colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Light theme | Dark Theme |\n",
    "|-----|-----|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#2af598;\">#2af598</p>|<p style=\"color:#08af64;\">#08af64</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#22e4ac;\">#22e4ac</p>|<p style=\"color:#14a38e;\">#14a38e</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#1bd7bb;\">#1bd7bb</p>|<p style=\"color:#0f9295;\">#0f9295</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#14c9cb;\">#14c9cb</p>|<p style=\"color:#056b8a;\">#056b8a</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#0fbed8;\">#0fbed8</p>|<p style=\"color:#121212;\">#121212</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#08b3e5;\">#08b3e5</p>||\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) If your plot needs multiple colors, choose an appropriate palette using either of the following tutorials:\n",
    "- https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html\n",
    "- https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Consider accessibility as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For qualitative plotting Seaborn's 'colorblind' palette is recommended. For maps with sequential or diverging it is recommended to use one of the Color Brewer schemes which can be previewed at https://colorbrewer2.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to design your own colour scheme, it should use the same principles as Cynthia Brewer's research (with variation not only in hue but also, saturation or luminance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to acknowledge your sources and any attributions using links or a reference list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have quite a few references, you might wish to have a dedicated section for references at the end of your document, linked using footnote style numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can connect your in-text reference by adding the number with a HTML link: ```<a href=\"#fn-1\">[1]</a>```\n",
    "\n",
    "and add a matching ID in the reference list using the ```<fn>``` tag: ```<fn id=\"fn-1\">[1] Author (Year) _Title_, Publisher, Publication location.</fn>```"

Prepared by SGS Economics and Planning (Jan-Jun 2021), forecasts are available for the municipality and small areas, as well as by gender and 5-year age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tram Tracks, Bike Paths, and Bus Stops Geospatial data\n",
    "For a visual representation of the current public and active transport routes, we require geospatial data for trams, bike paths, and bus stops. We can utilise the following to meet these requirements:\n",
    "- The [*Tram Tracks*](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Tram-tracks/wqka-kyhz), dataset contains the line number and geospatial data.\n",
    "- The [*Bicycle routes, including informal, on-road and off-road routes*](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Bicycle-routes-including-informal-on-road-and-off-/24aw-nd3i) dataset contains information about each of the paths along with the geospatial data.\n",
    "- Lastly, the [*Bus stops*](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Bus-stops/ss79-v558) dataset includes a range of information along with the latitude and longitude of Melbourne City bus stops. \n",

    "To understand the current volume of cyclists on bike paths, we can use the [*Annual Bike Counts (Super Tuesday)*](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Annual-Bike-Counts-Super-Tuesday-/uyp8-7ii8)) dataset. In summary, the dataset contains observed bike counts from sites across the city and is part of Australia’s biggest annual commuter bike count dataset. \n",
