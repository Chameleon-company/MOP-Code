  "name": "Mapping Graffiti and Illegal Waste Dumping Hotspots in Melbourne",
  "description": "This use case works with four differe datasets which includes pedestrian traffic data, customer service request data and developmental activity footprint data. These datasets are furthere explored and analyzed to identify patterns , trends and relationships that exists. We use the geospatial information for mapping and preedicting the hotspots as well.",
