    "description": "This use case focuses on analyzing residential density and venue seating capacity in the City of Melbourne using data from the 2020 CLUE Residential Dwellings dataset. By visualizing residential dwellings by city block and overlaying it with venue seating capacity, we can explore the relationship between where people live and the availability of venues. The interactive map provides insights into how residential density affects venue distribution, helping businesses and urban planners make data-driven decisions. The goal is to identify potential opportunities for venue placement or expansion based on population concentrations and seating availability.",
