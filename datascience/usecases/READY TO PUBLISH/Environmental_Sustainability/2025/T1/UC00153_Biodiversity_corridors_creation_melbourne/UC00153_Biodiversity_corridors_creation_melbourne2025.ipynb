By identifying laneways with high greening potential, we can connect these patches to create continuous green corridors that support urban biodiversity.\n",

    "<b>Scenario 2: Greening in Densely Built-Up Areas</b>  \n",
    "Some areas have very limited green space due to high-density development. This project helps find underutilised laneways that can be turned into green zones. This adds greenery where large parks aren't possible, benefiting both nature and local communities.\n",

    "<b>Scenario 3: Supporting Pollinators and Urban Wildlife</b>  \n",
    "Bees, butterflies, and small mammals need connected green routes to survive in cities. By greening laneways with the right plants, we can create safe pathways for them. This supports pollination and keeps the urban ecosystem healthy.\n",
