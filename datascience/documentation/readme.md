# Documentation
This folder contains all the documentation created for the data science team. The documents are organized to help team members access guides, templates, and resources quickly and efficiently.
When adding to this collection, it's recommended to include an easily editable version (e.g. docx) and a version that can be referred to easily (PDF is preferred as that will be viewable here on GitHub).
- There is a Word template available [here](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/MOP-Code/blob/master/datascience/documentation/Documentation%20template.dotx).
- File naming conventions is a short, descriptive title in sentence case.
