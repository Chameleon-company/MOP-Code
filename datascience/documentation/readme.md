# Documentation
This folder contains the documentation for the data science team.

When adding to this collection, it's recommended to include an easily editable version (e.g. docx) and a version that can be referred to easily (PDF is preferred as that will be viewable here on GitHub).

There is a Word template available [here](./Documentation%20template.dotx).

File naming conventions is a short, descriptive title in sentence case.
