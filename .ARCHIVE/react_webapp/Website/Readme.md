### Branching

Branches are used for isolated feature developments and should always branch from the source they intend to merge into.
Branches that are created from `main` will return to `main`.

Branch names should have an indicator of which team are you in. For example: `Username_WD` or `Username-webdev`

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to "Fetch" to update the repository before you push into the branch you are working on to avoid merge conflicts especially when collaborating with team members.

### Commit Messages

While there are no set rule for formatting commit messages we still have to be make sure the heading and the body are properly written.
You can use tags, as listed below ,which would help us identify what type of of commit is being being made.
