# Pedestrian Crash Risk Analysis & Prediction

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyses and predicts **pedestrian crash risk in Victoria** using road environment factors. The goal is to identify high-risk conditions (e.g., lighting, speed zones, road geometry) and provide interpretable machine learning models that support safer and more sustainable urban planning.

The work forms part of **Use Case 1 Traffic Analysis (T2_2025)** in the MOP AI+IoT capstone project, contributing to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities).

## üîß Pipeline Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Cleaned and filtered the Victorian Road Crash dataset
   * Performed feature engineering (categorical encoding, scaling, correlation-based selection)
   * Excluded post-crash outcome variables (e.g., fatalities) to ensure deployment feasibility

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Generated distribution and correlation plots
   * Analysed crash frequency by speed zone, lighting, and road type

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Implemented classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network
   * Integrated the top-performing classifiers (Decision Tree + XGBoost) into a **Voting Classifier**
   * Achieved **97.92% accuracy** after redefining risk into binary classes (low vs high)

4. **Interpretability & Insights**

   * Produced feature importance and permutation importance plots
   * Identified key predictors of pedestrian crash risk

5. **Deployment & Visualisation**

   * Built a **Streamlit dashboard** to showcase results interactively
   * Provided recommendations for real-world deployment

## üìä Key Results

* **Voting Classifier Accuracy**: 97.92%
* **Target Refinement**: Binary classification improved interpretability and model performance
* **Stakeholder Recognition**: Product owner described the **98% traffic analysis accuracy** as ‚Äúvery impressive,‚Äù highlighting real-world applicability
