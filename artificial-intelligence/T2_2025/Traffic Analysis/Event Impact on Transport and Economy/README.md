Cities often face challenges when public events take place in busy areas. Weddings, film shoots, cultural festivals, and promotional events can block streets or attract large crowds, which disrupts traffic flow and creates congestion. Anticipating these disruptions is valuable not only for city authorities but also for individual road users. If a system can detect where and when an event is likely to happen, it becomes possible to plan detours, send alerts, and even recommend alternative transport options before congestion builds up.
The goal of this project was to develop a predictive framework using event permit data provided by the city. The dataset covers thousands of permits issued between 2014 and 2018 for various types of events across Melbourne. Our objective was to build and evaluate machine learning models that can identify patterns in the permits and predict the likelihood of an event happening on a given date and location. Beyond the technical task, the expected outcome is a system that can support real-world applications such as traffic management and proactive user notifications.
In this report, I will explain the steps we took in preparing and analyzing the data, the models we trained, and the insights we found. Each section connects back to the overall purpose: predicting event-driven disruptions so they can be managed more effectively.
