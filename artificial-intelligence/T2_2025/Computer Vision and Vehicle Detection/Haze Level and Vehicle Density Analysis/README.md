## Model & Results
- YOLOv8 trained with augmentation and extended validation set  
- Achieved **mAP@0.50 = 0.90**, **mAP@0.50–0.95 = 0.623**  
- Precision = 0.892, Recall = 0.803  
- End-to-end reproducible pipeline available  

---

## Challenges
- GPU memory limitations for large-scale augmentation and validation
- Managing dataset sizes during training
- Integrating haze estimation with vehicle detection efficiently  

---

## Next Steps
- Further hyperparameter tuning for YOLOv8 to improve accuracy  
- Scale pipeline to larger datasets  
- Explore real-time inference for deployment scenarios
