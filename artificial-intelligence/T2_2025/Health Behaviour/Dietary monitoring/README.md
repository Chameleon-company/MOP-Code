# Food-101 EfficientNetB0 ‚Äì Dietary Monitoring (Alen, T2 2025)

This folder contains the training and evaluation code developed for the **Dietary Monitoring and Nutrition Analysis Using AI** use case under the Health Behaviour team.

The goal of this work is to build a food image classification pipeline using the **Food-101 dataset** to support dietary tracking, calorie estimation, and personalised nutrition guidance.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** [Food-101](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) ‚Äì 101 food categories with 1,000 images each.
- **Model Architecture:** EfficientNetB0 (transfer learning with TensorFlow/Keras).
- **Training Strategy:** Two-stage approach (frozen head ‚Üí fine-tuning top layers) and an ultra-fast subset training mode for rapid prototyping.

The system is designed to support AI-powered dietary tracking by accurately recognising food items from photographs.

**Key Features:**
- Official Food-101 train/test splits with custom validation set
- Automated data preprocessing and optional augmentation
- Transfer learning using EfficientNetB0 (ImageNet weights)
- Two-stage training: frozen head ‚Üí fine-tuning top layers
- Ultra-fast training mode for rapid prototyping
- Accuracy/loss plots, confusion matrix, per-class classification report
- Sample prediction outputs for quick validation

üî¨ Methodology
Data Pipeline
Load official train/test splits from meta files

Create validation set (10% of train data)

Resize images to 224√ó224

Normalise for EfficientNet preprocessing

Optional: augment with flips, rotation, zoom, brightness, contrast

Model Training
Stage 1: Train only classification head

Stage 2: Fine-tune last 40 layers

Optional ultra-fast mode: balanced subset, capped steps

Evaluation
Training & validation accuracy/loss plots

Confusion matrix and classification report

Sample prediction visualisations


üìà Results (Ultra-Fast Mode Example)
Metric	Value
Test Accuracy	~0.22
Epochs	2
Images/Class	30
Training Time	~3 min

‚ö† Accuracy in ultra-fast mode is lower due to reduced dataset size and epochs. Full dataset training yields higher performance.
