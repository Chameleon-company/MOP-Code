    "   - **Subtopic**: Choose a wellbeing indicator like Personal Health.\n",
    "   - **Age Group**: Filter by age group (e.g., 18–24).\n",
    "   - **Gender**: Filter by Male or Female.\n",
    "   - **Suburb**: Narrow the results to specific locations.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Slow Loading**:\n",
    "   - Large datasets may take a few seconds to render. Be patient.\n",
    "   - Optimize your data processing scripts if needed.\n",
