Instructions - how to incorperate your Flask project into the collective app.


1. In the templates folder, create a .html file named (topic)_(description).
Example - Vehicle classifcation project that uses AI detection = vehicle_detect.html


2. We are using the base method to keep the pages similar style-wise.
Copy the following text and paste into the newly created html file:

---------------------
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %} (INSERT PROJECT TITLE HERE) {% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h2 class="section_heading"> (INSERT PROJECT TITLE HERE) </h2>
     <!-- INSERT YOUR FLASK APP HTML BODY CODE HERE-->
{% endblock %}
---------------------


3. Replace (INSERT PROJECT TITLE HERE) with the name of your project in both locations.
These instructions are assuming you have built a flask project with html code. If so, copy everything in between the <body> </body>,
not including the body brackets, and post it where the comment says to.
If you have not built a project yet, build the body section in that section.

The styles will be imported from our css file, so if you want to change how yours looks, either define <style> in your html or 
use a new class and update the css.file in the static folder to include your classes/designs.


4. If you need to create files for functions/databases needed for your app to work, create your own sub-folder within the /static/python folder, 
and make sure to reference the correct file/location when setting up your html file.


5. Setting up the routes.
Navigate to the app.py file in th main folder. Copy the following code and paste into the appropriate labelled area for your project.
Replace all  'project_name' with the name you called your html file:

---------------------
#Project Name
@app.route('/project_name')
def project_name():
    return render_template('project_name.html')
---------------------


6. Setting up links on project page.
Navigate to the main hmtl page of your topic area. 
Example - vehicle detection would navigate to vehicle_main.html.
Copy the following code and paste it below the other project links within the <p></p>.
Replace project_name with your route/project name (the name used in step 5)

---------------------
 <li><a href="/project_name"> (INSERT PROJECT TITLE HERE) </a></li>
---------------------


7. Save all. Refresh the app.py if it is running. Congratulations. Your project is now part of the collective app!
