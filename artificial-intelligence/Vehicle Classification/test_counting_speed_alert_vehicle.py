                <p>Dear Officer,</p>
                <p>Our advanced monitoring system has detected a <b>traffic congestion</b> situation that requires immediate attention. Here are the key details:</p>
                <p><b>üî¥ Traffic Details:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Location:</b> Flinders Street, Melbourne</li>
                    <li><b>Number of vehicles:</b> More than 20</li>
                    <li><b>Slow-moving vehicles:</b> More than 10 vehicles traveling below 20 km/h</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This could indicate a possible <b>traffic jam</b> on the road. Immediate intervention is recommended to alleviate the situation and avoid further delays or accidents.</p>
                <p>Stay safe and thank you for your swift response to ensure smooth traffic flow!</p>
