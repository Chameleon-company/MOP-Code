# Find Next Train Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Error Handling in `find_next_public_transport_trip` Function**
**File:** `actions/gtfs_utils.py`

**Issues Fixed:**
- Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Added input validation for station names
- Added fallback mechanisms when child stations are not found
- Fixed DataFrame indexing issues with proper error handling
- Added proper time parsing error handling
- Added duplicate trip detection and removal

**Key Improvements:**
```python
# Before: No error handling
stop_a_id = GTFSUtils.get_stop_id(station_a, stops_df)

# After: Comprehensive error handling
try:
    if not station_a:
        return "Please provide a starting station."
    
    stop_a_id = GTFSUtils.get_stop_id(station_a, stops_df)
    if not stop_a_id:
        return f"Station '{station_a}' not found. Please check the station name."
```

### 2. **Error Handling in `ActionFindNextTrain` Class**
**File:** `actions/actions.py`

**Issues Fixed:**
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Improved error messages for users
- Added proper exception handling without raising exceptions
- Added input validation

**Key Improvements:**
```python
# Before: Basic error handling
except Exception as e:
    GTFSUtils.handle_error(dispatcher, logger, "Failed to find the next train", e)
    raise

# After: Comprehensive error handling
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error in ActionFindNextTrain: {e}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
    dispatcher.utter_message(text="Sorry, I encountered an error while finding the next train. Please try again with different station names.")
    return []
```

### 3. **Error Handling in Supporting Functions**

#### `extract_stations_from_query`
- Added null checks for input parameters
- Added error handling for SpaCy NLP processing
- Added fallback mechanisms

#### `find_station_name_from_query`
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added input validation
- Added error handling for individual stop processing

#### `find_child_station`
- Added null checks for parent station ID
- Added error handling for individual stop processing
- Added fallback to parent station when no children found

#### `get_stop_id`
- Added input validation
- Added error handling for station lookup

#### `find_station_name_by_fuzzy`
- Added error handling for fuzzy matching
- Added input validation
- Added error handling for individual stop processing

#### `keep_staion_in_order`
- Added input validation
- Added error handling for station processing
- Added fallback to original list on error

#### `find_parent_station`
- Added input validation
- Added error handling for individual station processing
- Added fallback to original station name on error

## 4. **Data Structure Improvements**

### DataFrame Indexing
- Added proper error handling for MultiIndex operations
- Added fallback mechanisms when indexing fails
- Added validation for DataFrame structure

### Time Parsing
- Added proper error handling for time parsing
- Added support for both timedelta and datetime objects
- Added fallback mechanisms for time formatting

## 5. **User Experience Improvements**

### Better Error Messages
- More informative error messages for users
- Clear guidance on what went wrong
- Suggestions for how to fix the issue

### Logging Improvements
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Added error tracking with stack traces
- Added informative log messages for each step

## 6. **Robustness Improvements**

### Input Validation
- Added validation for all input parameters
- Added null checks throughout the codebase
- Added type checking where appropriate

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Added fallback to parent stations when child stations not found
- Added fallback to original station names when processing fails
- Added fallback to basic functionality when advanced features fail

## Testing

The fixes have been tested with:
- Basic functionality tests (passed âœ…)
- Error handling tests
- Input validation tests
- Edge case handling

## Summary

The `find_next_train` functionality has been significantly improved with:

1. **Comprehensive error handling** throughout all related functions
2. **Better user experience** with informative error messages
3. **Improved robustness** with fallback mechanisms
4. **Enhanced debugging** with detailed logging
5. **Input validation** to prevent crashes
6. **Better data handling** with proper DataFrame operations

The functionality should now work reliably and provide helpful feedback to users when issues occur.
