TomTom API Integration

Overview
The TomTom API is a powerful tool for route planning and traffic analysis. This document provides an overview of the key APIs, their usage, and implementation guidelines for integration.
•	TomTom API key was generated from “TomTom Developer Portal” https://developer.tomtom.com/user/me/apps
•	request library is used for API calls

APIs Used
1. Routing API
•	Purpose: Fetches the fastest route between two geographical points.
•	Endpoint: https://api.tomtom.com/routing/1/calculateRoute/{start}:{destination}/json
•	Required Parameters:
o	key: 1ktSQErBv5y6ykTlW0LmDKQ6cPH5yF8V.
o	traffic: Boolean, when set to true, includes live traffic data.
o	routeType: Type of route (fastest, shortest).
Request: GET https://api.tomtom.com/routing/1/calculateRoute/-37.813629,144.963058:-37.830601,144.980832/json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&traffic=true&routeType=fastest
Key Outputs:
•	lengthInMeters: Distance in meters (convert to kilometers if needed).
•	travelTimeInSeconds: Travel time in seconds (convert to minutes if needed).

2. Traffic API
•	Purpose: Provides real-time traffic data for a specific geographical location.
•	Endpoint: https://api.tomtom.com/traffic/services/4/flowSegmentData/absolute/10/json
•	Required Parameters:
o	key: 1ktSQErBv5y6ykTlW0LmDKQ6cPH5yF8V.
o	point: Latitude and longitude of the location in the format lat,lon.
Request: GET https://api.tomtom.com/traffic/services/4/flowSegmentData/absolute/10/json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&point=-37.813629,144.963058
Key Outputs:
•	currentSpeed: Current speed of traffic in km/h.
•	freeFlowSpeed: Speed under free-flow traffic conditions in km/h.
•	confidence: A value between 0 and 1 indicating data reliability.

Implementation Details
1. Fetching Route Details
The Routing API retrieves travel distance and estimated time between two points.
Here’s a Python example using the requests library: 
import requests
def fetch_route(source_coords, destination_coords, api_key):
    url = f"https://api.tomtom.com/routing/1/calculateRoute/{source_coords}:{destination_coords}/json"
    params = {
        "key": api_key,
        "traffic": "true",
        "routeType": "fastest"
    }
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    return response.json()

2. Fetching Traffic Data
The Traffic API provides real-time traffic conditions for a specific location.
def fetch_traffic_data(location, api_key):
    url = "https://api.tomtom.com/traffic/services/4/flowSegmentData/absolute/10/json"
    params = {
        "key": api_key,
        "point": f"{location[0]},{location[1]}"
    }
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    return response.json()

3. Analyzing Traffic Status
Traffic conditions are derived by comparing current speed to free-flow speed.
def analyze_traffic(current_speed, free_flow_speed):
    speed_ratio = current_speed / free_flow_speed
    if speed_ratio >= 0.8:
        return "light"
    elif speed_ratio >= 0.6:
        return "moderate"
    else:
        return "heavy"
