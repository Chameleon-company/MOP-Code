Yin and yang, it's hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud :)"}
{"instruction": "I am looking forward to getting a new vacuum on Tuesday. I haven't bought a new vacuum in years. It's long overdue.", "output": "Oh, I love cleaning, so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed. What kind of brand?"}
{"instruction": "I almost got hit by a semi truck today on the highway. It scared me half to death.", "output": "Woah! I'm soooo glad you're okay!  Those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous.  I stay as far away from them as I can."}

Its always tough in relationships but when you can't go see her or make her talk to you afterwards, I'm sure its extra hard.  Did you call back and tell her that?"}

{"instruction": "My sister has been down in the dumps lately after a breakup. I made her come over to watch funny movies and eat popcorn and pizza to get her mind off of it.", "output": "I'm really sorry to hear that. What's worse is the best thing for breakups, the only thing that really helps, is time passing by. But the people who are hurting, in the moment, they can't really understand or accept that. So, you feel like you have to help and do something, when in reality it's probably best you don't smother them and that they have space. I hope she feels better, though."}

{"instruction": "I just had a pretty good meal at the Olive Garden.  I would say I am satisfied.", "output": "Right on, that sounds cool. Did you go with family, or a date? Or maybe just hung out there alone? That's okay, too. I love Italian food, had always wanted to go to Olive Garden, but my dad hates Italian. So when we were growing up, we just never went. Now that I'm on my own, I've been... twice. Both times, they were just okay."}
{"instruction": "Just found out I'm not getting a promotion at work that I was up for. I'm kind of bummed to not be moving up in the company that I work for, as I really like everyone here, and the company itself, and what we do. But I'm satisfied knowing that someone more deserving than me got it, and that they still see me as worthy in the long run, and that I still get to enjoy my current situation.", "output": "I'm sorry the hear that.

{"instruction": "I'm going to Vegas next weekend. I can't wait!", "output": "That sounds so exciting get ready for sleepless nights and long nights gambling."}
{"instruction": "I'm going to drive a truck. Never driven a car that big before.", "output": "I'm sorry, but I don't envy you... I've always just driven a little sedan. I'm an alright driver, but if I had to drive something bigger, I'd be nervous, too. Too easy for me to make mistakes. I kind of dread the day where I'll have to drive a big Uhaul truck. I hope things go well for you, though."}
{"instruction": "My wife just got a promotion and a 10% raise. I should be ecstatic for what this means for our family and financial future, but it's hard to not let my selfishness and ego get in the way, and think about how she's been more successful than me. We're currently in the same industry.", "output": "Maybe you can observe what she's doing and use that to advance in the industry as well."}
