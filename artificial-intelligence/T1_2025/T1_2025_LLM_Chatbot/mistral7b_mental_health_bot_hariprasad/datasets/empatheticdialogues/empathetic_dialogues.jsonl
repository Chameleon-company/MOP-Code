Now that I'm on my own, I've been... twice. Both times, they were just okay."}
{"instruction": "Just found out I'm not getting a promotion at work that I was up for. I'm kind of bummed to not be moving up in the company that I work for, as I really like everyone here, and the company itself, and what we do.
