Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen during Thanksgiving so you could have a chance to be around others?", "output": "My little sister caught off a chunk of my hair when I was sleeping last night. She did it because I came up with a fun but mean nickname for her the day before. But that was way over the line!"}

How long were you trapped for?", "output": "Someone spray-painted my car last night_comma_ wrote some curse word. I have no idea why_comma_ since i have no enemies.

But now I have to go out of my budget to fix this mistake when it shouldn't have been my problem in the first place. And I have no one to take my anger out on or to get justice from. I didn't even bother calling the police."}
{"instruction": "Wow_comma_ that's some really slow shipping times. Maybe you will get lucky and they will come in the mail sooner.", "output": "I waited so late some were on back order. I couldn't afford the other ones. I explained to the school though. I'm just embarrassed"}

{"instruction": "After my divorce I have no one.", "output": "You may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need"}
{"instruction": "Where do I go to meet them?", "output": "Neighbors_comma_ co-workers.  Try and get involved in local sports or comunity groups.  How about volunteering.  That is a good way to meet people that are positive"}

{"instruction": "I am just sad she isn't alive anymore.", "output": "I can understand that. That does sound like a difficult thing to deal with. Hopefully you have a lot of nice memories you can look back on to remember her by."}
{"instruction": "That's actually a really interesting way to frame it. We try hard to survive because we know how fragile we are as a species. If we weren't so fragile_comma_ we'd take it for granted. Interesting perspective!", "output": "Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features"}
{"instruction": "I felt very special and appreciated when my supervisor praised my work in front of other team members during our weekly meeting", "output": "I bet that was a nice surprise! That's pretty cool. What was it for_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?"}
{"instruction": "We develop enterprise software solutions for business per client request_comma_ and i was able to create a very efficient algorithm", "output": "That's really cool...

I guess I kind of get it_comma_ but I feel in your case it could be a huge positive!", "output": "Well_comma_ we don't like unnecessary attention_comma_ and we don't like talking about ourselves. We just like skyping between each other_comma_ and that's it. And talking on the phone_comma_ of course."}

But my luck ran out like a week later_comma_ because then I got ticketed for speeding in some lame speed trap. Karma_comma_ I guess.

{"instruction": "that is really nice of you", "output": "I got in a bit of an altercation with a co-worker today_comma_ and I'm afraid it may lead to me losing my job. It started with a misunderstanding_comma_and when they didn't want to simply accept that it was a misunderstanding after I apologized_comma_ I decided to simply defend myself and there was a verbal back-and-forth witnessed by a few people. This is not the image I wanted to have at my job..."}
{"instruction": "Sometimes you gotta stand up for yourself.", "output": "Yeah. I didn't want to seem like a whiny brat_comma_ but I didn't want to seem like a pushover either_comma_ especially when I thought it was stupid to fight about it to begin with. If I lose my job_comma_ it won't be the worst thing_comma_ since it's just a part-time job to get me through college. But I still hate the feeling that I let people down_comma_ or that I look dumb in other people's eyes."}
{"instruction": "I did not expect that kind of reaction! But I guess I don't know enough about possums. Maybe that makes sense. I compare them almost to raccoons_comma_ who I've seen be very aggressive. Well_comma_ it looks you made a new friend. I hope you named them!", "output": "I had lost my iPad in an airport a week ago_comma_ and even though it had my contact information_comma_ I wasn't sure it'd be returned to me. I just figured it was gone for. But it showed up today_comma_ in the same condition!"}
{"instruction": "You are so lucky!", "output": "Yeah_comma_ I know! I feel like I need to go buy a lottery ticket or something. I had already started looking online for replacements_comma_ and it came in today. Things like that restore your faith in humanity_comma_ as stupid as that sounds. I mean_comma_ it's just an iPad. I'm lucky to even have one. So_comma_ I did feel a little childish getting that sad over it."}
{"instruction": "That must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with. To constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support_comma_ and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head. You have to be really resilient to go through that.", "output": "Its been ten years and it doesnt even show up half of the time. I told the judge the last time I don't even want it anymore."}
{"instruction": "I have to deal with an entitled person lately and I can't stand it.", "output": "Oh no.  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant.  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you're near a snob."}
{"instruction": "Oh man...SO TRUE! It really makes me want to be nasty. Behaving like a dictator is not acceptable from even a dictator!", "output": "Seriously!  I just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesn't always means they are better than me just because they are entitled.  As they say_comma_ everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time."}
{"instruction": "Two girls and one boy.  I want them to live with me forever. Their kids too lol", "output": "Haha_comma_ that's incredible. A lot of parents wouldn't feel that way... After 18_comma_ they're done. That's pretty cool of you to feel that way_comma_ but I guess that speaks volumes about the kind of kids you have and how good they are. It sounds like you raised them right."}
{"instruction": "Why is that?", "output": "I feel panicked. I don't like being around a lot of people at once. I wish I didn't feel that way but I just don't like big stores and lots of people."}
{"instruction": "That is something that is a dream! Enjoy it so much! congrats", "output": "Well I am in a relationship kind of..but they are away and I can't talk to them so I am quite lonely."}
{"instruction": "I am so sorry to hear that.  When will you see them again?", "output": "It depends on what they do in therapy. I cannot live with them they way they have been so it's a pickle."}
{"instruction": "I've owned 3 birds in the past 10 years and my 3rd bird just died last night. I didn't realize how much it would crush me. They were my buddies.", "output": "There's absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better about that. I'm sorry for your great losses. Just from those few sentences alone_comma_ I can tell you were very passionate about them. What were their names_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?"}
{"instruction": "Thank you.  That's so sweet of you to say.  They were parakeets named Snowball_comma_ Curacoa_comma_ and Panda.  I think the best thing for me to do is get another one soon to continue to enjoy their sweet personalities.", "output": "Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea_comma_ as long as you're comfortable with it. It's such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void_comma_ but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don't live up to their predecessors. My girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes. She's already getting nervous since her dog is 10-years-old."}
{"instruction": "My significant other woke up last night with... a roach inside of her ear! She was complaining about pain in her ear_comma_ and a head ache that was incredibly severe. So_comma_ we took her to the doctor and he saw it with a light... and put water in her ear to get it out. Disgusting!", "output": "Oh gross!  I've heard of flies or ants being in an ear_comma_ but a roach?  That gives me chills because I hate roaches sooooo much.  Now I might have nightmares tonight!"}

And then they get stuck_comma_ and they freak out_comma_ so they're essentially just biting the inside of your head to try and get out. It's horrible to think about_comma_ and I've been trying to comfort her since when it happened a little bit ago. But she's getting over it soon. The weird thing is we don't even really ever see bugs in our house_comma_ so it was kind of like a one in a million thing. I bet she sleeps with ear plugs in her eyes for the next few years though...", "output": "EW!  I might start sleeping with ear plugs in now too.  I've heard you eat 8 spiders on average in a lifetime_comma_ some in your sleep.  So many things to be scared of with bugs! I'm so glad they were able to get it out.  Tell her I hope she gets over the trauma of it okay."}
{"instruction": "I filled the cart_comma_ got to the register. and I had left my purse at home", "output": "Oh my god! I have done something similar before. I don't get embarrassed easy but I know such things do sting a bit!"}

{"instruction": "I'm going with a Hoover. Yes I love things clean!  I haven't bought a new vacuum in years. It's long overdue.", "output": "A Hoover seems like a reliable choice. My girlfriend is a neat freak_comma_ and decided to go with a big purchase_comma_ a Dyson_comma_ which is more expensive. I've used it and it's not bad. Still not sure I'd pay as much as she did for a vacuum cleaner_comma_ but who am I to argue. Anyway_comma_ I'm happy for you."}
{"instruction": "Woah! I'm soooo glad you're okay!  Those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous.  I stay as far away from them as I can.", "output": "I know_comma_ I always try to_comma_ but my wife was in labor so she was making me pass everyone on the road."}
{"instruction": "Well_comma_ that's understandable.  I've had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?", "output": "My son has been having stomach pain for months now and the doctors can't figure out what it is. They basically say he has to get worse for them to find a diagnosis if some new problem comes up. I'm so scared."}
{"instruction": "I completely understand that.  Things are always scary when it is happening to your kids_comma_ but there is hope!  Have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet?  Or doctor Fuhrman_comma_ or doctor Michael Greger?  I think it could heal your son!", "output": "What is that?  None of the doctors told me about that.  I will look into it.  Thank you! You've given me hope I never knew I had!"}
{"instruction": "What happened to it?", "output": "He ran when my dog charged at him though and I am scared of what has happened to him. A lot of cats get hit around here"}

But his parents kept trying to force him to eat something anyway_comma_ and were being short-sighted. Well_comma_ the poor fella ended up puking onto his plate and ending everyone's appetite."}
{"instruction": "I feel sorr for the poor guy!", "output": "Yeah_comma_ me too! I tried to comfort him afterwards. There's only so much you can do. No one was brave enough to chastise the parents for trying to get him to eat more than he should."}
{"instruction": "You must really miss him! So glad you'll finally be reunited with him.", "output": "I did...immensely.  Its the hardest thing I've ever endured with him leaving_comma_ especially because I have to young kids.  We're going to have a huge party!"}
{"instruction": "Oh you have kids_comma_ too? They're going to be so happy!", "output": "I'm going water skiing next weekend. It's going to be such a breather from all this heat we've been getting lately."}
{"instruction": "Wow. Im sorry", "output": "Learned earlier today that I had been drinking all day out of a cup that had been used earlier by someone who has bronchitis.

{"instruction": "People can be inconsiderate sometimes. I hope you don't get sick!", "output": "Well_comma_ we'll see. I'm generally pretty healthy and haven't been to the doctor in like over 6 years for anything other than the flu. So_comma_ hopefully my immune system will keep it at bay. But it was just it's something so simple and avoidable_comma_ and they didn't do it. I guess I should feel more empathy for them though_comma_ since they're sick."}
{"instruction": "Oh man_comma_ Costco pizza is great_comma_ and so cheap_comma_ too. It may not be the best_comma_ but for the price and quantity_comma_ you can't really beat it.

{"instruction": "I know. it really ruins any faith I have in people.  Plus_comma_ it was so much money that I had saved for quite a while and now I'm back to square one.  I could explode thinking about it.", "output": "I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it."}
{"instruction": "Yeah_comma_ you're right. It's kind of complicated_comma_ but I definitely shouldn't try to pick sides. I just want everyone to get along_comma_ but it's not that simple. It's like I can't figure out if I try to make peace_comma_ whether that will make things more complicated or not_comma_ and whether I should just stay out of it. Time will tell.", "output": "It is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations.  This might be a situation that calls for some professional help."}
{"instruction": "I woke up one morning and found a puppy in my bed. I wasn't expecting that!", "output": "Whoa! Was that a good surprise_comma_ or a bad surprise? I could see that going either way_comma_ but at least it would be exciting! I had that happen when I got one for Christmas. Well_comma_ actually it was in my parent's bed_comma_ and I barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents_comma_ and I saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with."}

{"instruction": "Yea. I'm so used to living in the center of the city. Nothing but cars and buildings. I already feel so relaxed here.", "output": "Sometimes it means increased work commute_comma_ or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. It's all a balance. I'm glad you seem to have found yours!"}
{"instruction": "My friends are always flaking on me", "output": "That's terrible. Sometimes it's hard to know who your real friends are_comma_ and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them_comma_ only to have them bail on you_comma_ to realize that you're not valued by them.

When you consider all that_comma_ then yeah_comma_ definitely cut ties.

{"instruction": "Oh god that's terrifying haha. I hate snakes.", "output": "Yeah_comma_ me too. I find them interesting_comma_ but would never want them as a pet or anything. Seeing them once every few years in a zoo is fine with me. This one was a black snake_comma_ but that's all I really remember. Didn't get a good look. It slithered away fast. I think it was as scared of me as I was of it."}
{"instruction": "Well_comma_ absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained_comma_ but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more.

I'm just a doofus when it comes to social interaction_comma_ so I get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me.

How did the neighbors take it?", "output": "They were pretty respectful and understanding_comma_ and realized that those things just happen_comma_ especially when kids are involved. They appreciated that I came and told them right away. Mostly it was because the dent isn't that serious and they feel like they can get it out without much problem. But yeah_comma_ I'm glad I don't have a jerk for a neighbor who would have blown up"}

What will you be doing specifically?", "output": "I was hiking the other day and I ran across a dead deer with maggots eating on it. It smelled so bad!"}

{"instruction": "That's what pictures are for. Are you guys ever going to live together?", "output": "We will eventually. But I'm in school right now_comma_ and she has a good job_comma_ so neither of us are able to move_comma_ and haven't been able to for a few years. We'll get there eventually though."}
{"instruction": "The snails? Yikes. Well_comma_ I've always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should_comma_ and probably doesn't taste that bad.

{"instruction": "That's great_comma_ so you enjoy looking after them?", "output": "They can be a handful. They're not the most socialized_comma_ so especially when we have other children over_comma_ they don't quite interact well_comma_ and they easily misunderstand situations. But I do appreciate the brotherly bond they have. It's something to be envious of."}
{"instruction": "Maybe take a few days to think it over_comma_ and then when the weekend comes_comma_ think of a way to surprise them in order to make it up to them. Or if nothing else_comma_ just be as honest as possible and not try to cover anything up when you need to bail on them. They'll appreciate that the most.", "output": "My girlfriend and I had an argument this afternoon_comma_ while she's about to go away to see relatives for a week. It's kind of a bummer because we don't really communicate that well_comma_ especially when it comes to arguments. It usually devolves into us rather not talking instead of trying to fully speak out our issues."}
{"instruction": "I am sorry_comma_ I guess some friends just argue like that", "output": "Yeah_comma_ which is fine if we were just friends_comma_ but we're significant others and we plan to get married_comma_ so it's kind of worrisome that after years being together that we're not better at communicating_comma_ or at least working through an argument. It's hard for us to put aside our personal feelings and be objective_comma_ but only when it's with one another_comma_ for some reason."}

It's a slow process in the beginning_comma_ but it can be life-changing."}

The worst timing ever!", "output": "I'm really sorry to hear that... That's the worst scenario too_comma_ because you're parked and probably not even there_comma_ so you were completely powerless in the situation_comma_ and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you. Maybe there's something that can be worked out_comma_ since you just purchased it."}

{"instruction": "Aw_comma_ that is really cute of your cat to do.", "output": "Yea_comma_ she's a sweetheart. First cat I've ever owned and I realize now that I'm a cat person as opposed to a dog person."}

So on refunds.", "output": "Don't you hate it when you're feeling confident in a new hairstyle or some clothes you're wearing_comma_ and then someone makes fun of you? Had that happen the other day.

{"instruction": "That is just the worst_comma_ who made fun of you?", "output": "It was actually a stranger_comma_ and I was on public transportation. They didn't actually say anything to me_comma_ I could just tell the way they were giving me a look_comma_ and kind of shaking their head and then laughing to themselves_comma_ that it was pointed at me. Maybe I read too much into it. Either way_comma_ made me want to sink into the ground"}
{"instruction": "That's so disappointing. People should really not be judging others when they don't know how much effort was put in to the outfit.", "output": "I think it was my haircut :( But thank you for the kind words. I need you to hype me up in the morning and make me feel confident!"}

Was she over for a special occasion at all?", "output": "We grilled a couple of hotdogs and hamburgers_comma_ and we're roommates basically.

Her parents are actually pretty laid back and fun to be around_comma_ so I'm looking forward to it. Glad I don't have to deal with overbearing in-laws like some people"}
{"instruction": "That's good. Were you nervous at first?", "output": "Heck yeah I was. I think everybody is. But then once you get over the annoying stage of saying all the general stuff about yourself_comma_ and meeting them for the first few times_comma_ it got pretty easy"}
{"instruction": "Have had this roommate for a year. Decided to renew lease with him. Been pretty good so far.. except he has a problem remembering to flush the toilet--no matter whether it's #1 or #2. Getting kind of old.", "output": "That is a very big problem to me! However_comma_ if you signed a new lease with him it seems as if you can deal with it right?"}
{"instruction": "Yeah I guess.. I mean it's much more annoying to me to have to do another roommate search. Searching for roommates and apartments in general is just so annoying_comma_ and I'd rather spend the time trying to make money for rent and all that. But yeah_comma_ not sure why some people have these kind of quirks.", "output": "Well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year.

In fact_comma_ I miss them right now", "output": "I've been having to pee a lot lately. I know that's one of the symptoms of diabetes_comma_ and my dad has diabetes_comma_ too. Kind of worried to go to the doctor and get checked out."}

Glad you found what you wanted."}
{"instruction": "Right? I'm in the same situation and was expecting this place to be filled up since it's right next to the campus!", "output": "I live right next to my campus too! The downside is it's a building made in the '50s and looks terrible on the inside. But I can bear it since I'm saving money. Most college kids have their parents money and just choose a fancier place because they don't care about money."}
{"instruction": "So... Last night I saw a huge black spider in my room. Took me like 20 minutes to muster up the courage to attack it. Well... I tried attacking it_comma_ and missed_comma_ and it went behind a piece of furniture and I couldn't find it again. I slept in another room..", "output": "I hate that!

I feel bad for making her do that_comma_ but I don't have much of a choice", "output": "Aw_comma_ you shouldn't feel bad!  At some point you'll have more cash and do the treating.  There's a lot of give and take in relationships."}
{"instruction": "Yeah_comma_ I know_comma_ I just hate people paying for me_comma_ or feeling like a burden. That's like my #1 thing. But it's weird to say \"no_comma_ we can't go do this fun thing just because of me_comma_ even though you want to.\" So it's a rock and a hard place. I guess I will just have to look forward to when I can return the favor", "output": "I totally get it.

{"instruction": "We're going to be fishing near black duck bay.", "output": "Fun times!  I did a little beach fishing not long ago at New Smyrna.  I hope you catch some cool fish!"}
{"instruction": "I'll try.", "output": "This lady at my work is so sweet_comma_ and no one there seems to like her. I feel so bad for her."}
{"instruction": "Oh_comma_ bless her heart. I hope you are nice to her.", "output": "I am.  I can tell she's lonely.  She told me her husband died awhile back so I think she's lonely too."}

I think I might be getting old because sometimes I like sleeping more than being awake.", "output": "Okay so I've never been a good cook but the first time I ever made a casserole was a diasaster. I went to pull it out of the oven and part of my oven mitt must have not been insolated well_comma_ so I dropped it and it shattered the door to my stove."}

{"instruction": "We had to have a talk the next day. One had no memory of the night and the other half apologized. We've moved on_comma_ but I'm still sore about it.", "output": "I would be too.  Its not fun when a couple people ruin a night that should be a great time!"}
{"instruction": "What was your favorite class?", "output": "Depends on what way you're talking about Maybe physics 1 or maybe calc II.  Thats where things really started to come together for how things work +  the math to understand how things work."}
{"instruction": "Sounds like fun. Are you excited?", "output": "Kinda.  I'm excited to see who takes the class and help them learn to decorate cakes_comma_ but teaching the class is the easy part."}

{"instruction": "Yeah_comma_ my wife says the same thing.  My boss is kinda intimidating though and it causes me to second guess myself at times.", "output": "Don't be ashamed or set yourself short espcially since you worked so hard. If you feel scared or hesitant to do so than I would talk to her boss to possibly set up a meeting."}

I am healing as well. Healing is NOT easy", "output": "Healing is never easy. It always has the negatives. Any sort of healing always starts with pain_comma_ a open wound_comma_ and itchy scabs_comma_ and the left over scar. I wish I could talk to you daily and help you get through it.

Luckily I had another suit in the office I changed into."}
{"instruction": "Okay_comma_ so I never understood why people ate it. What is it about it that makes them want to do that? I just flicked mine. And I thought it stopped at a child's age. Really interesting.", "output": "I was so grossed out by it.  I think it has to be a oral fixation or something like that."}
{"instruction": "I kept thinking I had left the front door unlocked whilst I was on vacation!", "output": "That is a terrible feeling. I saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home. That would be the worst."}

{"instruction": "Haha good timing by your roommate. Does he not knock?", "output": "He did.. and I said_comma_ \"Hold up_comma_\" but I guess he heard something else? I mean... c'mon man. It's annoying. I wish my door had a lock_comma_ but it's some old 1950s apartment complex and everything is old. I guess people from the 50s didn't need to lock their doors. Lucky them. But I guess they had lamer porn back then_comma_ too."}
{"instruction": "Oh yeah I know what you mean about hospitals. They are always so busy and you see lots of sick people.", "output": "My best friend got such a pretty girlfriend. I don't know how he does it. I look better than him but he gets the pretty girls."}

I wish there was some way I could help you_comma_ it is such a tough road.", "output": "Yeah_comma_ I'm not looking forward to going down it. I'll just try to carve out as much meaningful time with her as I can.
