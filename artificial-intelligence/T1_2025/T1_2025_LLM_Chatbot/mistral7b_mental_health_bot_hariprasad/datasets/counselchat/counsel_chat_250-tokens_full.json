, you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before . i have seen people cry with sadness , cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time , cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard . i myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving . i can assure you that most , if not all , therapists expect clients to cry and there is nothing to be embarrassed about . crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down . crying is often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with

with depression or high anxiety , that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form ( addiction ) that would utilize this new

someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes , in this case sadness or depression , and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior ( such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist ) and working to extinguish the unwanted
