However, it's clear that these methods haven't been effective for you. It's essential to acknowledge that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and what works for one person might not work for another. Today, we're going to approach this differently. We're going to identify a specific concern related to your mental health that you'd like to work on, and we'll break it down into manageable steps. We'll define the problem as a feeling of being overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions, and we'll set realistic goals for managing this feeling. We'll explore the root causes of this confusion, such as past traumas, current stressors, and any underlying psychological conditions. We'll also examine your thought patterns and emotional responses to these triggers, and we'll develop strategies to challenge and reframe negative thoughts. This process is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and it's designed to help you face your challenges more effectively by changing the way you think and feel about them. Let's begin by discussing the specific incidents or concerns that have been contributing to your feelings of confusion and chaos. We can explore these further and come up with strategies to help you manage them.\"}\n"
