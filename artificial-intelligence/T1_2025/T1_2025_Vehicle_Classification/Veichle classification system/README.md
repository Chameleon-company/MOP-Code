This vehicle classification project was developed by a team of three: Abdulqadeer, Brian, and Lokesh.
Contributions:
Brian: Focused on building and training a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, including the necessary data preparation steps.
Lokesh: Worked on alternative data processing techniques for the dataset.
Abdulqadeer: Developed the ensemble learning system that combines predictions from Brian's CNN, a fine-tuned YOLOv8 classification model, and a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 model. Abdulqadeer also created the script for applying the trained ensemble to classify new images (predict_folder.py).
