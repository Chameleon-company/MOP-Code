# Human Activity Recognition using PAMAP2 Dataset

This project implements and evaluates machine learning models (starting with LSTM) for classifying human physical activities using sensor data from the **PAMAP2** dataset. The goal is to improve predictive accuracy and compare different deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTM, GRU).

## Current Progress

- **Feature Selection**: Top 25 features selected using Random Forest.
- **Model Implementation**: LSTM model trained and evaluated.
- **Performance Tuning**: Architecture tuning, step_back optimization, class balancing.
- **Upcoming**: Implement GRU model and compare with LSTM.
