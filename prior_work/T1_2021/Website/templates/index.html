                <h2>Hello! Welcome to the City of Melbourne Council Pedestrian Count Prediction Portal.</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='images/flinders_street.png')}}" align="right" width="400," height="300"> According to a report released by <a href="http://www.climatecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/report-primed-for-action.pdf">Climate Council, 2020</a>, a clean and healthy environment impacts the community's habitability in such an environment and its overall prosperity. About 80 per cent of Australians were affected directly or indirectly by the unprecedented scale and severity of bushfires and smoke haze that occurred in 2019-20 summer. This led to about 33 people's death due to fire, 417 due to smoke haze, while many people lost their homes and nearly one billion animals killed. Although, the City of Melbourne council had a comprehensive Climate Change Adaptation Strategy that was issued in 2017, which helped guide its decisions and actions during these events. Also, the council believes that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions impacts these natural disasters. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The 2019-20 summer bushfires experience severely impacted business activities in tourism, retail, hospitality, cultural and sporting events, and people could not transport themselves to work in the city. Clarke, et al., 2019, opined that the impact of climate change would occur, even at a more frequent rate and more severe in the future. In response to this rapidly changing trend of the adverse impact of climate change on the city's habitability, the council came up with a  <a href="https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/melbourne-submission-technology.doc">Technology Investment Roadmap Discussion</a> Paper. The paper discusses the challenges faced by local governments due to the changes and the opportunities that can be harnessed from new and existing technology in the transition to net-zero emissions. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">This project relates one of the four priorities identified by the council towards achieving the emissions reduction targets on transport. The council is committed to investing in infrastructure and programs to increase walking, cycling, and public transport use.</p>

                <h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Project Scope</p></h2>

               <p style="text-align: justify;">This project aims to assist the City of Melbourne council's decisions to encourage Melbournians to adopt measures that would facilitate reduction of carbon content within the city, organize events within the city to improve the financial status of the businesses affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, manage the energy consumption levels and invest in renewable energy.</p>          

				<p style="text-align: justify;">The project showcases visualisation of prediction of total pedestrians' count for next three weeks in the CBD. This dashboard is updated through the automated ETL forecasting pipeline. Client can analyze the granular level data using visualisation of total pedestrians' count forecast between March 2021 to August 2021 for five major locations pedestrian data. The sensors are located at Victoria point, Southern Cross Station, Collins Place North, Flinders Street and Bourke Street Mall South.</p> 

				<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, due to the councilâ€™s focus to deliver 100 per cent renewable energy, zero emissions buildings and transport and a circular economy. The council believes that possessing a tool that can help them to predict what future energy consumption is a plus.</p> 

				<p style="text-align: justify;">Consequently, the team worked on an interface for real-time energy consumption prediction till August 2021 using deep learning algorithms.</p>  
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Enabling officials to determine pedestrians' count for a specific day for the whole city of Melbourne, for some sensor locations as well as energy consumption to help the council make appropriate decisions on measures to promote walking towards contributing their quota in achieving net-zero emission by 2040.</p>
