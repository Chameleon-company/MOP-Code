	<h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Exploratory Data Analysis on Rainfall</p></h2>
	
	<div>	
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Below are various graphs to demonstrate the trend of the weather variable ‘Rainfall (mm)’. The daily rainfall forecasts. are probably the most viewed part of our city forecast. The rainfall dataset was collected from Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), which is range from January 2015 to March 2021. This information is useful for people in Melbourne who are planning outdoor activities, or whose work or travel may be dependent upon the weather. As a result, we believe that our pedestrian system output is associated with rainfall feature.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">The figure below is scatter plot to view overall distribution of rainfall. It gives us insight the relationship between rainfall and time series (January 2015 to March 2021). In details, most days are sunny because we can see a large number of points clustered at 0mm. Furthermore, there are extremely mist day especially in 2020.The max rainfall amount is 54.6mm happened on 2020-03-05. And the average rainfall amount in 2020 is higher than average rainfall amount in other years</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">This histogram displays the distribution of rainfall amount from January 2015 to March across Melbourne. The average and median costs are 1.5mm and 0 mm, respectively. Given that the rainfall data is unimodal, with one local maximum and a right skew, the fact that the average is greater than the median, matches our expectation. The range of rainfall amount is very large, 55mm with the smallest rainfall amount equal to 0mm and the largest rainfall amount equal to 54.6mm. There is one day, 2020-05-03, that rainfall amount far more than the rest at 54.6mm.</p>
